# IDM-reset

Hi,

I had the same problem so got this script from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/bq78ji/idm_popup_fake_serial/
Dedcided to share coz It's worked for me really well.

I developed a script that resolves the problem and clean all IDM modifications.

it is a ".bat" file (you can open it with a text editor to understand it)

you have just to download "subinacl.exe" (https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=23510) from a safe source, and put it in the same directory of the script because the script run it one time at the begining of the script.

Enjoy!!!
