Hi,

i had the same problem last year.

I developed a script that resolves the problem and clean all IDM modifications.

it is a ".bat" file (you can open it with a text editor to understand it)

you have just to download "subinacl.exe" from a safe source, and put it in the same directory of the script because the script run it one time at the begining of the script.

Enjoy
